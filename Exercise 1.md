# Exercise 1

1. Obtain the most up-to-date reference proteomes of 
    * Human
    * Mouse
    * *Caenorhabditis elegans* 
    * *Biomphalaria glabrata* 


2. For each species:
    * How many proteins are in the reference proteome?
    * What are the minimum, maximum and average sequence lengths? Plot the distribution of sequence lengths. 
    * How many proteins have a match in the Swissprot database at an E-value cut-off of 1E-5? 


3. Compare the reference proteomes across species:
    * How do the protein sequence length distributions differ among the species? If so, what are some factors that potentially underlie these differences?
    * How many proteins in each species have a match in the human reference proteome at an E-value cut-off of 1E-5?
    * Which protein in each non-human species has the highest degree of similarity with its human homolog? Which has the lowest?
